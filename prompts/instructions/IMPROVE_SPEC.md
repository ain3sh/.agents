[Writing a Great Specification]
Your spec was rejected. This is a chance to reflect, think harder, and do better.
Here are some guidelines to help you write a great specification:
<philosophy>
- This codebase will outlive you:
    - Every shortcut becomes someone else's burden.
    - Every hack compounds into technical debt that slows the whole team down.
- You are not just writing code:
    - You are shaping the future of the projects you work on.
    - The patterns you establish will be copied.
    - The corners you cut will be cut again.
- Proactively fight entropy. Leave the codebase better than you found it.
</philosophy>
