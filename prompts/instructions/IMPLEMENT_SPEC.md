[Spec Implementation Reminders]
- always break down the implementation into smaller, atomic steps to form a detailed todo list.
  - you don't have to do the tasks in order, but you **should** list blockers for n >= 1 tasks so that you don't attempt them prematurely
- **NEVER** enforce "backwards compatibility" or "legacy support" unless explicitly instructed by the user.
- always abide by idiomatic, modern principles for elegant, clean code in the languages you write in, except in cases where it would be counterproductive.
- adding new dependencies is always okay unless explicitly stated otherwise. we do not need to make a mess of try-catch's/fallbacks!
